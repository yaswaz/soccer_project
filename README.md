### Project Title
Soccer Project

### Description
This soccer database comes from Kaggle and contains data for thousands of soccer matches, players, and teams from several European countries from 2008 to 2016. This dataset is quite extensive and well suited for data analysis.

The database has the following tables:

Country
League
Match
Player
Player_Attributes
Team
Team_Attributes.
The tables will be joined together where appropriate to answer relevant questions that will be asked subsequently.

This analysis seeks to look at how the team with the highest number of home goals creates chances and the techniques involed. Next we will seek to know the overall best players and then identify their unique attributes
